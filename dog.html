        <p class="section-intro">
            Every dog in Samoa deserves a safe place to sleep, enough food, and people
            who care. This page explains how the adoption process typically works with
            local rescues and clinics.
        </p>

        <div class="education-card">
            <h2>1. Find a Dog</h2>
            <p>
                Start on the <strong>Adopt</strong> page to browse dogs currently available.
                Many come from local vets, foster homes, or volunteers who found them on
                the streets.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Contact the Caretaker</h2>
            <p>
                Each dog has someone responsible for their care. This might be a clinic,
                a foster family, or a small rescue group. They can tell you about the
                dog’s temperament, health history, and what kind of home would fit best.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Prepare Your Home</h2>
            <p>
                Before bringing a dog home, make a safe sleeping area, plan for regular
                feeding, and review the Education page so you know how to handle pests,
                heat, and basic training.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Follow Up Care</h2>
            <p>
                Many dogs will need vaccines, deworming, and possibly spay/neuter
                surgery. Staying in touch with your vet and local rescues helps keep
                your new family member healthy and happy.
